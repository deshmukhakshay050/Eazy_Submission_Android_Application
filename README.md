# Eazy_Submission_Android_Application


College Code submission system is manual.Teachers manually check the student code to find any errors and conduct viva
Where as our android application accepts code from student to find any erros by doing lexically analysis on the submitted
code.If error is there code is rejected.If correct questions are asked on the concepts which they have used in code with timer.
Thus the process is automated.
